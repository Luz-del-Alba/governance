The platform is mounted in Ubuntu VM instance on azure cloud.

Since we are using docker to release the artifacts, within the VM we are managing Docker Swarm.

### CI/CD

Every project contains this file

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml 
```

This file is allowing us to perform Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment out of the box via `GitHub Actions`

This enables us to deploy to our environment every time you commit on `master`

### Services

On this platform where are using several servis like `redis`, `mongodb`, `postgresql` and is maintained by us, you will
be able to stand up/tear down the services that we are using.
